\subsection*{4--1. \textbf{Characterization with deflection history} [4 pts].} 
A simply supported beam is made from a material that is well-described by a three-parameter standard linear solid model, i.e., the general creep compliance function $J_c(t)$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    J_c(t) = J_\infty + (J_0 - J_\infty) \exp\left[-\frac{t}{\tau_c}\right],
\end{equation*}
where $J_\infty$, $J_0$, and $\tau_c$ are all mechanical properties of the material. 

The beam has a length of 4 ft and a second moment of area about the out-of-plane axis of 1 in$^4$. 
It is subjected to a position-time separable load function $q(z,t) = \hat{q}(z) \phi(t)$ where $\phi(t) = -3$ lb/ft $\cdot \mathcal{H}(t)$. 
Say we determine the maximum deflection in the beam at different times to be
\begin{align}
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -0.6 \textrm{~in~~at~~}t=30\textrm{~min}\\
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -0.75 \textrm{~in~at~~}t=60\textrm{~min}\\
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -1.0 \textrm{~in~~at~~}\textrm{~long times}
    \end{align}
From this, calibrate the material properties.


\subsection*{4--1}

From the class, the load is distributed as function
\begin{equation*}
    u(y,t) = -\frac{x^4 - 2Lx^3+L^3 x}{24E}\int^t_{0} \phi(t-\tau)\dot{J_c}(\tau) d\tau  \\
\end{equation*}
Do the Laplace transformation, we get
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{L}\{u(y,t)\} &= -\frac{x^4 - 2Lx^3+L^3 x}{24E} s \phi(s) J_c(s) \\
    &= -\frac{x^4 - 2Lx^3+L^3 x}{24E} s \frac 3s (\frac{J_{\infty}}{s} + \frac{J_0-J_{\infty}}{s+1/\tau_c}) \\
    &= -\frac{x^4 - 2Lx^3+L^3 x}{8E} (\frac{J_{\infty}}{s} + \frac{J_0-J_{\infty}}{s+1/\tau_c}) \\
u(y,t) &= -\frac{x^4 - 2Lx^3+L^3 x}{8E} (J_\infty + (J_0 - J_\infty) \exp\left[-\frac{t}{\tau_c}\right]) \\
\end{align*}

From $-(x^4 - 2Lx^3+L^3 x)$, the maximum deflection point is at $\frac L2$. The maximum $u_y$ is $\frac{-5L^4}{128I}J_c(t)$. For three points given in the problem we can get 
\begin{align*}
\frac{-5\times4^4}{128} (J_\infty + (J_0 - J_\infty) \exp\left[-\frac{30}{\tau_c}\right]) &= -0.6 \\
\frac{-5\times4^4}{128} (J_\infty + (J_0 - J_\infty) \exp\left[-\frac{60}{\tau_c}\right]) &= -0.75 \\
    \frac{-5\times4^4}{128} J_{\infty} &= -1 \\
\end{align*}
Solve these questions, we get 
$J_{\infty}=0.1$

\subsection*{4--2. \textbf{Ramp up the torque} [4 pts].} 
A viscoelastic cylinder $AB$ is fixed on its end $A$ and simply supported on its opposite end at $B$. 
At point $B$, a second, rigid rod is joined to the end such that exerting a force on the rod will induce a counterclockwise torque about the axis of $AB$. 
A point force of magnitude $P_0$ is applied to the rigid rod, causing the front face to turn counterclockwise. 
The point force travels along the rod such that its distance from the bar's neutral axis $a(t)$ is direct in time, i.e., $a(t) = \alpha t$, where $\alpha$ is a constant. 
What is the angular rotation of the end $B$ as a function of time, $\Phi(t)$?

\subsection*{4--2}
The time-dependent torque on B is $T_z = \alpha P_0 t$. For viscoealstic cylinder, we have the relation 
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial(\bar{\phi}(z,s)}{\partial z} =\frac 1{J_z} \bar{T_z}(z,s)\cdot\bar{\mu_c}(s) \\
\end{equation*}
We have 
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\partial{\phi}(z,t)}{\partial z} = \frac 1{J_z} T_z(z,t) *\mu_c(t) \\
\end{equation*}
Since the twisting moment is the same across the whole cylinder, which implies $\frac{\partial{\phi(z,t)}}{\partial z}$ is independent of z, leading to
\begin{equation*}
    \phi(z,t) = \Phi(t)\frac zL
\end{equation*} \\
Thus, we obtain
\begin{equation*}
    \Phi(t) = \frac {\alpha L P_0} {J_z}t *\mu_c(t) \\
\end{equation*}
where $J_z$ is , $\mu_c$ is the shear compliance.

A one-piece polymeric member \textit{ABC} consists of two segments of length $L$ at a right angle from one-another and encastred at $A$, as shown. 
Its neutral axes both lie in the $x-z$ plane when unloaded. 
Assuming the creep compliance in shear to be $\mu_c{t}$ and the creep compliance in axial tension to be $E_c(t)$, determine (a) the deflection at $C$ in terms of the time-varying force $F(t)$ and (b) the stress tensor $\mathbf{\sigma}(t)$ at the square surface el ement located above $A$.  

\subsection*{4--3}
From the free-body diagram, we have
\begin{align*}
    A(t) &= F(t) \\
    T_A(t) &= F(t)L
    
\end{align*}

\subsection*{4--4. \textbf{Fibrous material} [4 pts].}
An elastic material with a fiber phase has the Helmholtz free energy function
\begin{equation*}
\widetilde{\psi}(\bn{F}) = \frac{1}{2}C_{10} (I_1-3) + \frac{1}{4} k (I_a - 1)^2,
\end{equation*}
where $I_1(\bn{C}) = \textrm{tr}(\bn{C})$ and $I_a(\bn{C},\hat{\bm{a}}_0) = \hat{\bm{a}}_0 \cdot \bn{C} \hat{\bm{a}}_0$ for $\bn{C} = \bn{F}^\intercal \bn{F}$.

(a) 
\begin{equation*}
    \widetilde{\psi}(\bn{QF})=\frac{1}{2}C_{10} (I_1(\bn{F^T Q_T Q F}-3) + \frac{1}{4} k (I_a(\bn{F^T Q_T Q F}) - 1)^2
\end{equation*}
Since $\bn{Q_TQ} = I$, so the

\subsection*{4--5. \textbf{Gent model of rubber elasticity} [4 pts].}
The Gent model, which incorporates the finite extensibility of polymer chains in a rubber network but includes $I_2$-dependence, has a free-energy function of $$\bar{\Psi} = -\frac{C_{10}}{2} J_m \ln \left(1 - \frac{I_1-3}{J_m} \right) + C_{01}\ln \left(\frac{I_2}{3}\right), $$ where $C_{10}>0$, $C_{01}\geq 0$, and $J_m>0$ are material constants.

\medskip
(a) Show that the Cauchy stress corresponding to the free energy above has the form $$\bm{\sigma} = -p \bn{I} + \frac{C_{10} J_m}{J_m - (I_1-3)}\bn{B} - \frac{2C_{01}}{I_2} \bn{B}^{-1}.$$

\medskip
(b) This material undergoes a simple shear deformation of magnitude $\gamma$. Given that the shear modulus $\mu(\gamma^2) \equiv \beta_1(\gamma^2) - \beta_{-1} (\gamma^2)$ where $\beta_i$ corresponds to the expression for $\bm{\sigma}$ in Q1, show that in the small strain limit that $$\lim\limits_{\gamma \rightarrow 0} \mu(\gamma^2) = C_{10} + \frac{2}{3} C_{01}.$$
